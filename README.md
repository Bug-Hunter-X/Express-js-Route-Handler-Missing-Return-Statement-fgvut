# Express.js Route Handler Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing a `return` statement within conditional logic. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incomplete responses.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data. If the user is not found, it should return a 404 status code. However, the `if` statement lacks a `return`, causing both the error response and the successful response to be sent. This is because after the if block it executes the next line. This leads to inconsistent behavior, where both the 404 and the successful response will be sent to the client. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected version. The `return` statement is added to the `if` block, ensuring that the 404 response is returned only when the user is not found.
